# DBK
Simple Java desktop app to create and work with the databases of your localhost.

First of all it will only works if you have your databases on your localhost (I did it with Bitnami). You have to be sure your mysql is running on 3306 port, if it doesn't, it won't work neither. I will correct it soon.

You must have an user created to access to your databases.
